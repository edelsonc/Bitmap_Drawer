<h1>Drawer</h1>

Drawer is a small python application that creates bitmaps! It was created as the solution to a daily programming challenge on reddit. Drawer creates ppm files, which can be converted to any other image format with the use of a tool such as imagemagick.

<h3>Installation and Requirements</h3>
Simply copy the scipt onto your machine and type the following:

<code>$ python drawer.py foo.ppm</code>

That's it. Drawer requires python 3.4, and only used the standard library.
